# Companies-Manager

Prerequisites
-----

I assume you have installed Docker and it is running.

See the [Docker website](http://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/#h_installation) for installation instructions.

Build
-----

1. Clone this repo

    git@github.com:soukainahikma/Companies-Manager.git

3. 
    cd Companies-Manager

4. Build the image
```
    docker-compose build --no-cache
```
    docker-compose up

   ... This will take a few minutes.

6. Once everything has started up, you should be able to access the webapp via [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) on your host machine.

        open http://localhost:8080/
